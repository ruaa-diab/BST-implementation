This  is an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in Java. The goal is to create a simple structure that allows you to insert and search for elements in a sorted manner. It also includes basic tree traversal methods like Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder, which let you visit the tree in different ways. Additionally, the project has a couple of extra features, such as finding the height of the tree and counting the number of nodes. This project is great for learning how Binary Search Trees work and can serve as a base for exploring more advanced data structures like AVL or Red-Black Trees. To run the project, just clone the repo, compile the Java files, and run the Main.java file.
